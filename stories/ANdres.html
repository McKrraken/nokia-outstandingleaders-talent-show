          <h1>Andres	Parra</h1>
          <p class=text-align:justify;>
            It was the time of my first job, I was an auditor and I wasn't out (only my closest friends knew). My auditing group was big (around 20 audit assistants, 3 seniors, and 1 manager) but I got assigned to a small company from the business conglomerate my group was in charge of. I had a different office from the rest of the team and, to be honest, I felt some relief about that; I wasn't particularly good at making friends. <br>

I remember I always avoided questions related to my couple or my plans during the weekend. I avoided those questions even from a colleague I talked to daily. We used to share that small office cause he was assigned to the same cluster; it was only the two of us pretty much all the time there. We were "friends" but I was never candid about ... you know ... the people I was romantically interested in. He once told me he didn't feel comfortable around LGBT+ people; that was one of our first conversations. <br>

Once we had a huge meeting with the newest partner for our group, we were supposed to introduce ourselves and hear from him the expectations for the following year. By the time it was my turn to talk, I got a glimpse of my manager with a weird expression on his face, he looked ... malicious. At the same time, my colleague was looking at his cell phone and he looked kind of pissed off. To me, it seemed that they were chatting ... I was a little paranoid back then but something really caught my attention at that moment ... my manager was making fun of me while I was talking in the meeting? <br>

I couldn't get that idea out of my mind. I waited for the day to end and the next one I confronted my colleague, I asked him directly about that moment; I knew I didn't get the whole picture but I needed to know what had happened. <br> <br>

My colleague was really honest about it, he told me our manager was "impersonating" me during the meeting ... He showed me the whole conversation on WhatsApp: <br> <br>
Manager: Hi, my name is Andrés and I'm super gay<br>
Colleague: Dude, I'm trying to stay focused<br>
Manager: I'm Andrés and I have a boyfriend .. it's (the name of my colleague)<br>
Colleague: Come on! Knock it off<br>
Manager: So sweet, defending your boyfriend! Awwwww<br>
Colleague: I will stop talking to you now ... <br> <br>

I felt so vulnerable! I promise to you, I did my best to be a great employee and nevertheless, I was the joke for guys like my manager. I felt devastated :( <br>

My colleague saw my expression and told me: He's just silly ... I don't really care about who you like ... want some coffee?<br> <br>

We never talked about that moment again. But that day I found support from someone I never expected to back me up. He wasn't the biggest ally to the community at that moment but he was a really good friend to me. He gave me some hope when I felt I didn't have enough to grow on a professional path. <br>

I resigned one year after that but I kept in contact with that colleague. We still being friends and he's now aware of my sexual orientation. Now we can talk freely and drink coffee every now and then.<br>
