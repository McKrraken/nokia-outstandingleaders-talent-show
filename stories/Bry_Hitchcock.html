          <h1>Bryanna	Hitchcock</h1>
          <p><br>
            Hello everyone,
Several years ago, a news story about a brave transgender teenager on the East Coast profoundly changed my life. <br>
The teenager had gone to motor vehicle department to get her first drivers’ license. The state employee refused to take her picture, saying she could not have her photo taken with “girls’ clothes and makeup,” even though this was her everyday attire for high school.<br> The teen sued her state and won the right for herself and other gender-nonconforming people in her state to have their drivers’ license photo reflect who they really are.
Her victory was not just a legal win; it was a personal revelation, a lightning bolt moment.<br> In the transgender community, we often talk about the moment your "egg cracked." For me, this was it. <br> My parents and grandparents have all passed and I realized the only person I needed to answer to was my wife.<br> What was my excuse? What was holding me back? It turns out the answer to that is a lot of ingrained shame about my body and heart. But, inspired by that teenager's courage, I decided it was time to start my transition.<br>
Coming out to my wife was my next big hurdle. In my research, it was clear that hiding who you are from your spouse often causes further harm and feelings of distrust. She had always been unconventional—"not the straightest arrow in the quiver," as I affectionately say. <br>Her primary concern was my safety, as transgender people experience violent crimes at a higher-than-usual rate. However, she also worried about the potential career impacts.<br> For very many transgender people around the world career options are extremely limited, to say the least. And her fears were well founded; <br>I lost my job later that year during a convenient round of layoffs, as my former company wasn't prepared culturally to handle a transgender employee.
However, losing that job opened a new door for me. After searching for the better part of a year, I joined HPE’s networking division, a place where I am encouraged to bring my whole self to work. <br>Here, I found a community that valued my talents and hard work, regardless of my gender identity. In particular, HPE’s anti-harassment policies, annual trainings, and emphasis on building an inclusive culture made a huge difference.<br> Importantly, the people I work with live that culture and have always made me feel welcome and supported here. HPE culture and values are not just words on a website;<br> they are goals and guidelines that have a significant impact. 
Yet, I often think about the millions of transgender individuals who are not as fortunate, living in places where they cannot be safe or free. This realization strengthened my resolve to use my position of privilege to support others.<br> I vowed to seize every opportunity to come out, acting as an ambassador for the transgender community.<br>
Throughout this journey, I’ve lost some friends but gained many more—along with supportive colleagues worldwide.<br> Transitioning has not only alleviated my long-standing depression but also unlocked profound happiness and fulfilment in my life. I am grateful for the supportive environment at HPE, which has played a significant role in my success.<br>
Transition saved my life. The closet was suffocating and living in fear is no way to live at all. <br>That's why I continue to share my story, year after year, hoping that my visibility helps foster a more tolerant and safer world for people like me.
