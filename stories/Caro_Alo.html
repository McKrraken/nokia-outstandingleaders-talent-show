          <p>
            Three years ago, I was starting my working day and logged onto Nokia's Intranet to access some system, when I saw an advertisement for a leadership program called OUTstanding Leaders, aimed at the LGBT+ public. I had already been thinking about getting involved in some inclusion initiative within Nokia and, without thinking too much, I decided to apply. Until then, I had never mentioned to anyone at work that I had a girlfriend. 

            After a few days, I received the first contact from the program organization with a series of questions, one of which was specific: are you open within the company? The answer was "No, I wasn't". But I committed to do it as soon as possible because I felt I needed to do it. I was working at Nokia for 10 years and had never officially talked about it. I never felt like I could say I had a girlfriend at work. We feel afraid of being judged, of doing something wrong. 
            
            And what I can say was that signing up for the program encouraged me to open up little by little, first to my closest friends and colleagues within Nokia and then to my manager and my team. And I confess that it was one of the best feelings I have ever had. The program brought me a very enriching experience. We developed projects in partnership with Nokia's global partner law firms and the result was a year of a lot of learning, a new network of relationships and a sense of belonging that I didn't feel before. 
            
            Being in 2022's cohort, and coming out at Nokia, helped not only myself, but others like Tati Bomfim, from 2023's cohort, and Monica Mendonca from this year's cohort, who felt empowered to come out and to be themselves.
