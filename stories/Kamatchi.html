            "Be true to yourself and be who you are"<br><br>
Three years ago I moved across the world in search of a better lifestyle and career. Back then I was still in denial/confusion about myself. USA gave me a freedom to think about myself and what I actually wanted and who I was.<br> Slowly understood I do not need to be afraid to be myself. My roommates, who became friends and now family were the biggest pillar of support, there were the 1st set people whom I came out to. Never judged, always was ready to talk to me and listen when I needed. They gave me the confidence that the world was a better place and I dont have to be worried.<br> With that new perspective I moved to California from the east coast to work at Nokia. After an initial struggle at Nokia I moved into another technical team. Reached out to EQUAL USA at Nokia, who made me a point of contact for Sunnyvale. Forever grateful for giving me the opportunity to provide a safe space, create awareness about the LGBTQ+ community at work.<br>
In that process I came out to my Manager (who is also from my country and culture), He was and still is one of the most understanding person from my country, I have ever interacted with. While talking to him one day, he paused and said always interospect yourself. Re-evaluate your actions, make yourself a better person whith self introspection. You need to be happy. He added "Be true to yourself and be who you are, I understand it is not easy to be who you are when you come from a different country and culture. but be patient and make your family understand that this is you. It will take time but it will be fine. However gloomy the sky is one day the sun will come out." I finally came out to my parents a month ago and its still rocky with them but I my heart feels light and happy.
