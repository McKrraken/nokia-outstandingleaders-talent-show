          <p><br>
            The story I want to tell is one of inclusion, extreme communion, and sharing of good feelings.<br>
            One of the most intimate and collected moments of the three-day Workshop that kicked off the OUT Leaders 2024 program took place on the second day, at the Båtvik Training Center.<br>
            During the dinner, which was held at the center's restaurant, we were divided into small groups, and each group had the opportunity to get to know its members in an informal and very relaxed atmosphere.<br>
            I was at the table with Josh and Samuel (fictitious names 😉), with whom I had not had the chance to interact individually until that moment.<br>
            Thanks also to the preparatory work that we were assigned, which required each of us to reflect on ourselves and our own "story," the interaction during the dinner, aimed at getting to know each other, was very smooth and friendly.<br>
            Having the opportunity to freely express our essence and use that as a starting point to broaden the discussion and interaction with the other members at the table allowed us to gently "step into" each other's lives and get to know each other intimately.<br>
            From my perspective, I do not consider my belonging to the LGBTQ+ community to be a characteristic that distinguishes me more than others I possess (I usually say that I am a man, an engineer, a son, a brother, a friend... and also a gay man 😊), but speaking specifically about the LGBTQ+ community, I don't think I have ever felt as safe and included as I did on that occasion. <br>
            When I think back to that evening, I can feel the same positive and gratifying emotions that I experienced as if it were today.<br>
            Friendship, compassion, camaraderie, serenity, communion, calm, positivity, and a sense of protection were all present that evening, making it a truly unforgettable experience.<br>
