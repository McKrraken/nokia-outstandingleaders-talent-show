          <p>
            I don't remember why but for some reason, I listened to a trans woman's story about how she figured out she was trans. I was probably trying to understand what all the fuss was about on the subject of transgender people. Her story uncomfortably, and surprisingly, relatable. I didn't think that could be me. I didn't want it to be me. "Anything but that" is how I felt about the possibility of me being trans. I'd later learn from a therapist that that feeling is called "internalized transphobia". I did my best to stop thinking about it for the the time being.
 
A few months later, I was overwhelmed with curiosity to understand what was going on with me. Why do I feel so intensely unhappy? I'm going through the motions of life but, I'm not living. Why do I shower in the dark all the time? Why do I feel relieved when the doors open on the one elevator in my apartment with no mirror? I made a list of observations like this that support the hypothesis that I am trans. I made a list of reasons I'm not. There were about 5 reasons against and were all equated to "I don't want to be". The reasons in favour of the hypothesis... I stopped counting after 100.
 
Armed with that information, it still took a week of constant thought before I made progress with the idea. I was waiting for my therapist to diagnose me. After that week, I finally understood that being trans and even "gender dysphoria" is not a medical diagnosis; it's just another attribute that humans can have. With that, I had given myself permission to come out to myself.
 
That might make it sound simple but, I was unequivocally the most difficult person to come out to. The second and third most difficult would be my parents and my fiancé at the time. The reason being that I'm wondering, "how alone will I be after coming out to them?" My parents would take a while to learn and understand what that means but, they would finally get the name and pronouns right after 12~18 months. Their unconditional love would prevail. My then fiancé would go back and forth; being supportive half the time and being emotionally and physically abusive the other half.
 
I still had to worry about coming out to the rest of my circle, not to mention work. This filled me with such anxiety that I spent the entire month of September that year in a panic. Constant panic attacks, which I had never had before in my life. My jaw and back ached from the endless muscle tension. Despite sharing a one-bedroom with my fiancé, I never felt so alone.
 
It would take me until summer the following year to come out at work. Prior to that I had come out to friends, my doctor, and many more people in my life. It was exhausting. Every time, I'd have to explain basic terms and concepts like "LGBTQ+", "pronouns", "gender dysphoria", and sometimes even the difference between sex and gender. There was constant disrespect, almost always rooted in ignorance. Deadnaming in the waiting room for my doctor, misgendering at the hardware store, forced outing by the provincial government, a coworker even said to me that he is "always respectful when talking politics. Just like Ben Shapiro". If you are fortunate enough to not know who that is, he is a right wing pundit that is infamously transphobic (among other things).
 
It's been a few years since then. I'm now happily married, have a new doctor, and have most of my government ID issues sorted out. I also don't get misgendered anymore now that I've had 8 sessions of laser and >200hrs of electrolysis. But all the same issues still exist for those who come after me. There is still a lack of understanding by society and consequently a lack of respect afforded to me, and people like me. While I'm hopeful things will improve, if I use history as a guide, I see events like the Nazi book burnings at Magnus Hirschfeld's institute and in the past few years, governments banning transgender people from restrooms, sports, healthcare, and forcibly outing trans adolescents. All this and the layperson is still completely unaware of all of this and/or doesn't care. I fear that the lack of respect and dignity afforded to the trans community will never improve. Or perhaps, may worsen.
