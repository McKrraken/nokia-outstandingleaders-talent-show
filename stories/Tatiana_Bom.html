          <h1>Tatiana	Bomfim</h1>
          <p><br>
            "Throughout my professional journey, I was afraid to show who I really am in my work environment. For about 10 years, I was married to a 'man' who was actually a woman. I also had 'boyfriends' who were, in fact, girlfriends. To avoid judgment, I made up stories, invented names, and avoided awkward situations.<br>

I was always afraid of being judged and feared facing prejudice or retaliation for being myself in the companies I worked for. Iâ€™ve lost count of how many times I introduced my wife as a 'friend' to my coworkers and how many conflicts and personal problems this brought into my life.<br>

I was part of the OUTstanding Leader program last year, in 2023, which was the same year I learned that the program existed. When they introduced the program to me, I was astonished; I had no idea the company I worked for had such a massive and welcoming initiative.<br>

In January, I will complete 11 years at Nokia, and being part of this program was truly a turning point in my life, both professionally and personally. It gave me the support, security, and the same courage I felt at 17 when I came out to my family.<br>

I will always be deeply grateful for everything this program has given me. From the freedom to be who I really am, to providing a safe and welcoming environment, and the opportunity to meet incredible, encouraging people... people with strength and courage who inspire me every day."<br>
