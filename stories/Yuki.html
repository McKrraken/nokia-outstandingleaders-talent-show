            My Outstanding Journey to Authenticity at Nokia

When I joined Nokia, I already knew I was queer and non-binary. A key factor in my decision to work here was the company’s commitment to inclusion and diversity. During my interview, I made it a point to ask the recruiter how inclusive Nokia was, as I had faced discrimination in a previous role. The recruiter shared a video of our CEO, Pekka, talking about the importance of psychological safety. It was pride month, and I saw how Nokia celebrated it through events and initiatives. All of this reassured me that Nokia valued inclusion and that I could belong here. <br>

However, when I started working at Nokia, I wasn’t fully open about being non-binary. While I was clear about being queer, I hesitated to use neutral pronouns or change my name. I didn’t want to be seen as difficult or too different, especially since gender-neutral language can be more challenging in Portuguese, my native language. I felt isolated because there wasn’t a local Equal chapter where I could connect with others who shared similar experiences. It felt like I was carrying the responsibility for local inclusion initiatives on my own, which added to my hesitation in coming out fully.<br>

Everything shifted two years ago when I applied to the Outstanding Leaders Program. At the time, I hadn’t even changed my name in Nokia’s systems, out of fear of the potential repercussions. However, the program’s kickoff marked the first time I shared my preferred name at work, and to my relief, it was fully respected. For the first time in my career, I felt seen and understood by a group of people who had gone through similar challenges. The companionship and sense of community we built during those initial three days changed my life.<br>

After returning from the program, I finally gathered the courage to make a significant change: I updated my name in Nokia’s systems and started my social transition with my colleagues. Initially, it was very difficult. People would forget, deadname me, or ask uncomfortable questions about my "foreign-sounding" name. Some even made jabs about how they didn’t know HR allowed employees to change their names to "nicknames." These moments were stressful, but despite the challenges, it was the best decision I could have made. I finally felt like I could be my authentic self at work, just as I was outside of it.<br>

One of the most powerful moments during my journey was witnessing allyship in action. There were colleagues who actively corrected others when they misgendered me or used the wrong name. At first, I thought I would always have to advocate for myself, but seeing people step up to support me made an enormous difference. This kind of allyship gave me space to focus on my work and personal growth, without constantly worrying about being misrepresented or misunderstood. Allies became key players in creating an inclusive environment where I felt seen, respected, and safe.<br>

It all started with the Outstanding Leaders Program. That experience gave me the confidence to take steps I had been afraid to take for so long. It wasn’t just about changing my name—it was about finding a sense of belonging. Through the program, I met lifelong friends who have supported me through the toughest times. I was able to demonstrate my value through the meaningful work we accomplished together, and I was even selected to represent Nokia as a speaker for global pride. None of these opportunities would have been possible without the support and inclusion fostered by Nokia’s I&D initiatives.<br>

This journey has shown me the power of inclusive spaces, and how much of a difference they can make in someone’s life. Programs like OutLeaders don't just promote diversity on paper; they create communities where people like me can thrive. Being able to live authentically at work has not only allowed me to grow professionally, but it has also transformed how I feel about myself. Nokia’s commitment to inclusion gave me the confidence to be true to who I am, and I hope my story can inspire others to embrace their own journeys.          </p>
